HOW TO REPRODUCE RESULTS FOR TASK 1 & 2:
1. The relevant files are "NLP_task1.ipynb" and "NLP_task2.ipynb" for Milestone 2
2. The relevant files "NLP_task1_final.ipynb" and "NLP_task2_final.ipynb" for Milestone 3
3. The link for the dataset for both the task is "https://buffalo.box.com/s/k6lwci53eiw1sgge17denijgd22vsb86"
4. The results will already be there when you open the .ipynb file.
5. Execute the import statements at the top of the file. It's the first 3 or 4 code blocks.
6. Execute every block of code in order.
8. View results.

"pipeline_to_task3.ipynb" is the file, on how to import and use the fined tuned models of task 1 & 2 from Hugging face.

HOW TO REPRODUCE RESULTS FOR TASK 3:
1. The relevant files are "chordPros_semicolon.csv" and "NLP_task_3_modified.ipynb"
2. The results will already be there when you open the .ipynb file. If you want to spend time training, continue to step 3.
3. Execute the import statements at the top of the file. It's the first 3 or 4 code blocks.
4. Ignore the first two attempts which are labelled "DO NOT USE".
5. Starting from the Third attempt, labelled "ATTEMPT 3: USE THIS", execute every block of code in order.
6. View results.
